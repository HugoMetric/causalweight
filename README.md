# causalweight
causalweight is an R package for causal inference based on inverse probability
weighting (IPW). The causalweight package offers a range of semiparametric methods
for treatment or impact evaluation and mediation analysis, which incorporates intermediate
outcomes for investigating causal mechanisms. Depending on the method, identification 
relies on selection on observables assumptions or on instrumental variables when
selection is on unobservables, approaches that may also be applied to tackle non-random
outcome attrition and sample selection. Inference is based on the bootstrap.
